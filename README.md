Red language utilities and games

A former Rebol addict though I never mastered it, I'm now learning Red, and love to use it for some small production tools.
This repository includes:
* tools that I've had to develop for some app, like:
  * remap.red: various iteration functions traversing one or two series
  * parse-csv.red: convert csv file to and from Red nested blocks format; written before csv parsing was included in Red, I still use it
  * view-table.red: rudimentary table viewer and editor for csv-like data
* [games](https://github.com/Palaing/redlib/tree/master/games) / scripts written for fun or to contribute to promoting Red on http://rosettacode.org
