A few games written in Red, esp. to contribute to http://rosettacode.org

* 24game.red and 24gamesolver.red allow respectively to play and to solve the "24 game", see http://rosettacode.org/wiki/24_game and http://rosettacode.org/wiki/24_game/Solve
* noconnexion.red and noconnexionVis.red both solve the "no connection puzzle", see http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Solve_the_no_connection_puzzle; the second version adds a graphical display of the solution
* bof.red demonstrates a way to emulate ternary logic, see http://www.rosettacode.org/wiki/Ternary_logic.

Writing both 24game.red and bof.red challenged me about parsing and evaluating arithmetic expressions with or without parentheses. I report this experience and learnings in the wiki.
